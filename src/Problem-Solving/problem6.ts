//* Problem 6:
//* Create a class Person with a name and age. Then, create a subclass Student that adds a grade property. Include a method getDetails in the Student class that returns a string with the student's name, age, and grade.

//* Sample Input:
//* const student = new Student("Alice", 20, "A");
//* student.getDetails();

//*  Sample Output:
//* "Name: Alice, Age: 20, Grade: A";

class Person {
  name: string;
  age: number;

  constructor(name: string, age: number) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }
}

class Student extends Person {
  grade: string;

  constructor(name: string, age: number, grade: string) {
    super(name, age);
    this.grade = grade;
  }

  getDetails() {
    return `Name: ${this.name}, Age: ${this.age}, Grade: ${this.grade}`;
  }
}

const student = new Student("Alice", 20, "A");

console.log(student.getDetails());
